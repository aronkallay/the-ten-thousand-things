NOTE: on replacing audio files with higher quality versions

1. For string, percussion, piano1, and piano2 files, make sure they're named in the same convention (e.g. "34' - 1.wav", "34' - 2.wav") and replace the files in the corresponding folders under assets/audio. If the durations of the files change, update the variables [durations_string], [durations_perc], [durations_piano1], and [durations_piano2] with arrays containing the durations of each audio file, in order. 

2. For the speaker file, it will have to be chopped into smaller pieces. Make sure there's an EVEN number of pieces. Replace the [durations_speaker] variable with an array containing the durations of each piece (in order). Make sure the files are properly named, and place them in the assets/audio/45' for a Speaker folder.
